Welcome to Smile's documentation!
=================================

A project starts with a certain requirement, but as it progresses and
goes to the development cycle, it adds more feedback. It means
discovering and learning about new use cases, requiring features that we
were not specifically considered in the original design and its
assumptions.A software life cycle model depicts the significant phases
or activities of a software project from conception until the product is
retired. Typically, a life cycle model addresses the phases of a
software project: requirements phase, design phase, implementation,
integration, testing, operations and maintenance. The motivation behind
utilizing a life cycle model is to provide structure. As always, it's a
matter of picking the right tool for the job, rather than picking up
your hammer and treating everything as a nail. Smile is a tool that
eases control of the life cycle of a project.
