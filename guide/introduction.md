Introduction
============

Software life cycle models describe the interrelationships between
software development phases. The common life cycle models are:

**Waterfall:** In this type of development, each of the stages
(requirements, design, development, and test) are separate and do not
overlap. Each stage has a set of exit criteria which must be met
before the next stage can begin.

**Extreme programming:** Waterfall model does not work with shifting
requirement, in XP, coding starts as early as possible to detect
Emergent design.

**V-Shaped:** The V-Shaped model is the same as the Waterfall model
except that testing is a consideration throughout the development.
Each stage of development is matched with its equivalent stage in
testing: Requirements-System testing, High-level design-Integration
testing, Detailed design-Unit testing.

**Prototyping:** Prototyping consists of developing a partial
 implementation of the system to give the users a feel for what the
 developer has in mind. The users then give feedback on what they think
 of the prototype - what works and what doesnâ€™t - and the developer can
 make changes more easily and efficiently.

**Incremental:** Here, system is developed in different stages, with
 each stage consisting of requirements, design, development, and test
 phases. In each stage, new functionality is added. This type of
 development allows the user to see a functional product very quickly
 and allows the user to impact what changes are included in subsequent
 releases.

**Spiral:** The Spiral model of development, each spiral addresses a
 set of major risks that have been identified. Each spiral consists of:
 determining objectives, alternatives, and constraints, identifying and
 resolving risks, evaluating alternatives, developing deliverables,
 planning the next iteration.

Smile follows a merged model of Incremental and Extreme programming.
